AI-Powered Space Invaders with Python and Pygame
This repository contains the source code for the "Space Invaders" style game featured in our blog post on building games with Generative AI. The project demonstrates how to use an AI coding assistant (like Amazon Q Developer) to progressively build a complete and playable game from simple text prompts.


üöÄ About The Project
The goal of this project is to showcase how modern AI tools can democratize game development. By following the prompts outlined in our tutorial, you can generate this entire game, from basic player movement to a fully functional arcade shooter with enemies, scoring, and player lives.

This repository serves as the final reference code, allowing you to see the complete project and compare it with the code you generate.

Key Features
Player Control: Smooth left-right movement for the player's spaceship.

Invader Swarm: A grid of enemies that moves horizontally, drops down, and reverses direction.

Shooting Mechanics: Fire lasers to destroy invaders and score points.

Collision Detection: Lasers destroy invaders, and enemy lasers can destroy the player.

Scoring System: Gain points for each invader destroyed.

Game State: Win and lose conditions to create a complete gameplay loop.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project is built with a few simple, powerful, and free tools:

Python - A versatile and beginner-friendly programming language.

Pygame - A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

üîß Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. This project was built using Python 3.9, but any recent version of Python 3 should work.

Python 3.9+

python --version

pip (Python Package Installer)

pip --version

Installation
Clone the repository

git clone 

Navigate to the project directory

cd ai-space-invaders

Install Pygame

pip install pygame

Running the Game
Execute the main Python script to start the game.

python main_game.py

üéÆ How to Play
The controls are simple and classic!

Move Left: Left Arrow Key

Move Right: Right Arrow Key

Shoot Laser: Spacebar

Your mission is to destroy all the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen. Avoid their lasers and aim for the high score!
